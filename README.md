# RouchDB
Minimal CouchDB on Rust.

Dream: have a Rust database which can replicate to and from a Couch. No MR. Optimized for small docs with small attachments.

First Steps:
1. Write a HTTP database adapter
2. Write a replicator
3. Write a LevelDB database adapter


## State of Work

**Very** basic replication works \o/

### TODO
* make it work with attachments
* rething struct naming
