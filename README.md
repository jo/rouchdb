# RouchDB
Minimal CouchDB on Rust.

Dream: have a Rust database which can replicate to and from a Couch. No MR. Optimized for small docs with small attachments.

First Steps:
1. HTTP database adapter
2. replicator
3. database trait
4. LevelDB database adapter


## State of Work

**Very** basic replication between two HTTP dbs works \o/
